(**IMPORTANT** EVERYBODY READ THIS!)

* To run the project (for either development or test purposes), do the following steps:
    * Local MySQL server should be installed to run the project. MySQL root password should be "mbotm361".
    * It is recommended to use MySQL server integrated with NetBeans IDE.
    * Database named "course_automation" should be created.
    * "course_automation.sql" (which is in "setup" folder) should be executed on "course_automation" database to create tables used by the project.
    * "mysql-connector-java-5.1.22-bin.jar" should be added as library to the project.

* Collaborators must notice the following rules:
    * Don't forget to pull before committing anything to prevent conflicts.
    * If you will change anything that changes the database structure, change "course_automation.sql" then reexecute it to apply changes locally.
    * Don't forget to write explanations in your commits.
